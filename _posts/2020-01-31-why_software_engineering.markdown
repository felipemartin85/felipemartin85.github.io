Since I was little I have always been interested in technology and video games, but I did not have the opportunity to get involved in the area for many different reasons. 

The reason that pushed me to walk through the path of learning the skills of programming is the fact that  I want my dream to come true and furthermore, the fact that technology, internet, virtual communications, and apps have become indispensable. 

According to several resources and people out there, becoming a Software Engineer is not an easy task, and I agree, but this will not hold me back, I have told to myself that no matter what or how,  I will make this happen. 

The most important thing to me here is being part of a team. Having a team to support you and pushing you to succeed is amazing, and I found it with Flatiron School, they gave me the opportunity of sharing my story and the push I needed to pursue my dreams. 

I know this is just the beginning of a hard and stressful path, but I feel confident and excited to face it. So, if you are reading this article because you are thinking of immersing yourself in the coding land, let me tell you something, do it!.
